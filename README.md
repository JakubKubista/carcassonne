#### Goal of the project
After creation of elaborate design create java application - game, which sould include Exception handling, IO, containers, applets, streams, JUnits and network communication (Ant).

#### How to install
You can generate JAR file from the code or install Greenfoot environment and play it here.

#### How to play
Carcassonne is very popular table game for more players. Check the [Game rules](https://upsilon.cc/~zack/teaching/1011/gla/carcassonne/carcassonne.pdf), if you don't know them.  For better imagination you can check screen shots in the folder preview how to play this app. Basically, in the title menu you can choose number of players, their names and start the game. If you will be in the game, then you can see on the right side hint for each move during the whole game. Have a good game!

#### Notes
 I created demo version in 2014, which has still a lot of shortcomings (about purity of the code will be better keep silence), but this application represents my first desktop program with GUI so I really enjoyed it, because in the environment Greenfoot it is very simple.
